        <li>
            <b>No Hacking in Any Form</b>
            <i>Ban length depends on the severity of the incident</i>
            <p>Including but not limited to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Auto-clickers</li>
                <li>Xray packs</li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>No Cheating in the Real World</b>
            <i>One-week ban</i>
            <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sharing accounts</li>
                <li>Creating alt accounts</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Do Not Bring Conflict Outside the Server</b>
            <i>Warning or one-week ban (depends on severity)</i>
            <p>
                Do not start real fights over events
                within the server or cause real harm
                to people and their things.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Do Not Cheat the Server</b>
            <i>Permanent ban (potentially less: depends on severity)</i>
            <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ban evasion [PERMANENT ban]</li>
                <li>Assisting banned players [1 MONTH ban]</li>
                <li>Exploiting/degrading admins [1 MONTH ban]</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Admins Can Make Exceptions at Any Time</b>
            <p>
                This rule allows admins to ban people
                for any reason if the inciting event
                is deemed to be a "loophole" or clear
                taunt/jab.
            </p>
            <p>
                For minor offenses, a warning should
                be applied by the administrators
                before any punishment. For larger
                offenses, players should have
                recognised themselves and used common
                sense. An instant ban of appropriate
                length can be administered in this
                case.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This rule table is the baseline for server
        etiquitte. Assume, using common sense, additional
        rules for each of the servers. This means trying
        to find "loopholes" in the rules is potentially
        a bannable offense.
